============

Mathematics educational app to help students study for math subjects based on their topic-by-topic strengths and weaknesses. Sadly, we didn't finish, so all it currently lets you do is generate random integrals....oh wells. Consider this as a work in progress though :)

Special acknowledgement to Github user assanov's math web app for helping us gain inspiration for starter code format.
